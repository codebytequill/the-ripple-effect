## About The Project

"The Ripple Effect" is a single-page, interactive web application designed to build empathy and awareness for marginalized communities, specifically focusing on workers with disabilities. In a world driven by complex data and statistics, this tool aims to bring the focus back to the human element.

So often, the true consequences of job cuts or reductions in social safety nets like Medicare and Medicaid are lost in abstract numbers. This project tells the stories behind the statistics. By walking a user through a fictional-but-realistic scenario, it demonstrates how a single event—like a job loss—can create a devastating "ripple effect" that threatens an individual's financial stability, healthcare, and independence.

This project was born from a passion for using technology as a tool for activism and human equality, shining a light on communities that are often overlooked.

## How It Works

The application presents users with three profiles of fictional individuals, each with a unique situation:

1.  **Choose a Story:** Select one of the profiles (Maria, David, or Lena) to begin.
2.  **Follow the Steps:** The story unfolds in a series of four steps, showing the person's initial stability, the crisis event (like a job cut), the immediate healthcare fallout, and the long-term ripple effects.
3.  **Understand the Impact:** Financial data changes at each step, clearly illustrating the escalating crisis.
4.  **Take Action:** The experience concludes with a call to action, providing concrete steps and resources for users who want to help.
